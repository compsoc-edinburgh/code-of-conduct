# CompSoc Discord Server rules

CompSoc aims to be a nice, inclusive place for anyone interested in Informatics to chat about their interests.

Please follow the [Discord community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), as everyone using Discord (even through bridged IRC or Slack channels) will be subject to these, and we will enforce them.

**We do not tolerate harassment of people in any form**, including but not limited to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.

With that in mind, there is a single rule:

**Rule 1.** Be nice!

> Examples of not being nice may include:
> 
> • **Feigned surprise.** When someone says “I don’t know what X is”, you don’t say “You don’t know what X is?!” or “I can’t believe you don’t know what X is!”.
> 
> • **Well-actuallys.** That is the pedantic corrections that don’t make a difference to the conversation that’s happening.
> 
> • **Extreme Fanboy-ism.** Just because Programming Language X has feature Y doesn't mean everyone who doesn't use it is making the biggest mistake of their lives.
> 
> • **Trolling.** Posting something for the sole purpose of starting an argument or annoying other people is stupid.
> 
> • **Excessive conspiracy-theorying.** Consider making your own thread if you feel the need to negatively comment on everything related to a (reasonable) subject.
> 
> • **Bad faith arguments.** If you've already formed an opinion on a subject and "only wish to engage in a rational debate" even though you don't want to learn anything from it, just...don't.

Moderators reserve the right to exercise their discretion when deciding what behaviour is acceptable.

If you feel that another person is violating the rule, or you have other concerns, please contact one of the admins/moderators via a PM.
